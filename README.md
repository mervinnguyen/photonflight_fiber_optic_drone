# PhotonFlight: Fiber-Optic Autonomous UAV

PhotonFlight is a **fiber-optic-tethered autonomous quadcopter** designed for operation in **RF-denied or GPS-degraded environments**.  

The platform replaces traditional RF telemetry with a **secure bidirectional SFP fiber link**, enabling **low-latency video streaming, real-time telemetry, and reliable command/control communication** between the UAV and ground control station.

The system integrates **ArduPilot flight control, embedded Linux module, onboard AI vision processing, and fiber-optic networking**, demonstrating a complete embedded system spanning hardware, firmware, networking, and autonomy.

# Abstract

PhotonFlight is a **fiber-optic tethered UAV platform** developed for search-and-rescue and infrastructure inspection applications where traditional RF communication may be unreliable or unavailable.

The system leverages **single-mode fiber optic communication via SFP transceivers** to provide:

- RF-interference immunity  
- secure high-bandwidth communication  
- low-latency telemetry and video streaming  

An onboard AI camera enables **real-time object detection and autonomous tracking**, while a companion computer processes video and coordinates communication with the flight controller.

The result is a **robust embedded UAV platform capable of operating in communication-contested environments**.

# Demo

The video below shows the drone through its takeoff, tracking, and landing sequence. The drone first takes off in **Loiter** mode, switches to **Guided** mode, and then back to **Loiter** for landing. The tracking script is active at all times, but the flight controller only accepts the flight commands in **Guided** mode.

# System Architecture

PhotonFlight is composed of several integrated system layers that enable flight control, telemetry transmission, and onboard intelligence.


Each layer performs a specific role in the overall system.

| Layer | Responsibility |
|------|------|
| Ground Control Station | Mission planning, telemetry monitoring, system control |
| Fiber Communication Layer | Secure telemetry and high-bandwidth video transmission |
| Companion Computer | AI inference, video processing, communication bridging |
| Flight Controller | Real-time stabilization, sensor fusion, flight control |
| Motor Control | Direct actuation of propulsion system |

# Hardware Architecture

PhotonFlight is built using a combination of **commercial off-the-shelf components and custom fabricated hardware**.

## Airframe

The UAV uses an **8-inch quadcopter carbon fiber frame** providing structural mounting for propulsion, avionics, and communication hardware.

Key design considerations include:

- vibration isolation
- weight optimization
- secure component mounting

## Power System

The drone is powered by a **high-discharge LiPo battery** distributed through a **Power Distribution Board (PDB)**.

The power subsystem manages:

- high-current delivery
- electrical isolation
- voltage regulation for onboard electronics

Battery safety procedures and charge management protocols are implemented for safe operation.
